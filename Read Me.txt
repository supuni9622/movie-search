	ShoutOUT aptitude test - TV series search engine
============================================

This search engine is totaly based on react.

I would like to suggest you two methods to run this application in local environment

1st method-

	So you can open this folder in your code editer and go to 'movie-search' folder by typing 'cd movie-search' in your terminal.

	To install node modules and dependencies; command 'npm install'

	Then it'll be installed node modules and dependencies 

	Then type 'npm start' to run the application in local environment

	Application will be open in the browser by localhost:3000

2nd method -

	Use this method if only the above method doesn't work 

	Create react project called 'movie-search' by typing 'npx create-react-app movie-search'

	Then replace src folder by this src folder of this application

	Add bootstrap CDN and fontawesome CDN to 'index.html' file in 'public' folder

	Install react-bootstrap npm package using 'npm install react-bootstrap --save' command

	Type 'npm start' to run application
